# Dotfiles

This is my personal repo to unify the setup of all my devices. Currently only used for MacOS and still work in progess.

# Install

For installation simply clone the repo and run the installMac script.
This will run a complete setup with all desired tools and plugins and setup the dotfiles and symlinks. If there are other dotfiles present, they will be placed in an `dotfiles_old` directory for backup reasons.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ctrl-A-Del/dotfiles.git
cd ./dotfiles
sh installMac.sh
```
